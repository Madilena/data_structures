# Hash Table

These are my misc. notes on the hash table structure

## What is a hash table?

Best case O(1)
Worst case O(n) - with separate chaining all the keys are at one index in a linked list

Hash table part (array)
structure - hash table
method - insert ()
method - search()
method - delete()

bucket part (linked list)
structure - bucket
structure - bucketNode
method - insert
method - search
method - delete
